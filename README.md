# PaperScissorRock

this is one of the most lovable and famous games all over the world!.
i have never seen anyone in my whole life that didn't know this game or don't know how to play it, so i decided to create a funny "you against a zombie" PaperScissorRock game.

the Stone emoji represents the Rock.<br/>
the Leaf emoji represents the Paper.<br/>
the Scissors emoji clearly represents the Scissors.<br/>

# Game Play

You against a Zombie :) <br/>
It is as simpleas it gets : you just choose between Paper and Scissors and Rock and a random selection goes for the zombie.<br/>
The winner gets their pick highlighted and slightly bigger than the loser's pick and a count is set next to both players emoji<br/>
the newest rounds go on top and then scroll down as they get older and older so your new round and choice can always be on top.

# Deployment
